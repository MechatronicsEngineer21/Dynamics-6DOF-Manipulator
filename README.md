![Dexter6-Pro(6DOF_RoboticArm)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c285935-e235-4d78-8fff-b292335bcb67)

This repository contains the MATLAB-based dynamic modeling and simulation framework for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) robotic manipulator. The project is the third iteration under the Human-Centered Robotics Lab (HCRL), UET Lahore, and aims to create a locally developed, cost-effective robotic solution for industrial tasks like pick-and-place, painting, and welding.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

This project involves:

- Mathematical modeling of a 6-DOF robotic arm using Lagrangian and Newton-Euler dynamics
- Validation of the dynamic model in MATLAB/Simulink
- Comparison between built-in and custom dynamic models
- Simulation of individual and combined DOFs for torque, velocity, and position analysis
- Real-time inverse kinematics implementation in TwinCAT for eRob rotary actuators
